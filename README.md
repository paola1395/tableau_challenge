### How COVID-19 Affected Citibike
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is expected to see bike rentals decrease. After the announcement of the state-wide shutdown in NY near March of 2020, you can see the dramatic decrease in the amount of trips in April 2020 compared to April 2019. The decrease in number of trips are consistent in Spring, Summer and Fall 2020 (reflected in the Citibike Trip Count bar chart). However, there were more "customer" rentals in July/October 2020 and a decrease in "subscriber" rentals in April/July/October 2020.

### Who rents a Citibike?
Although there was a drop in rides in 2020, there was a dramatic increase in ride duration compared to 2019. I believe the increase in ride duration throughout 2020 was due to social distancing protocols and the temporary closure of businesses such as gyms and restaurants. Many people found greater interest in spending more time outdoors.
For example, in April 2019, the longest average ride among males was 11.7 mins at 36 years old. The longest average ride among females was 14.3 mins at 27 years old. In April 2020, the top 3 average durations among males were 83.8 mins (48 years old), 43 mins (38 years old), and 38.7 mins (29 years old). The top 3 average durations among females were 101.5 mins (41 years old), 81.7 mins (32 years old) and 49 mins (28 years old). A similar trend could be seen in July and October 2019/2020.
Citibike's top users are within 28-34 years of age. The top 3 ages among male and female "customers" are 29-30. The top 3 ages among male "subscribers" are 32, 31, and 34. The top 3 ages among female "subscribers" are 33, 31, and 30. Males rent more bikes than females as well. 

### How the Pandemic Changed User Behavior
The following data compares the top 10 number of trips and their start/end times in April, July and October 2019/2020. All times are approximate.

In April 2019, the most popular start and stop time was 8am. Near the start of the statewide lockdown in April 2020, the most popular start time changed to 3pm and stop time changed to 4pm. I believe this change occurred because less people were commuting in the morning for work and renting for recreational use.
In July 2019, the most popular start and stop time was 8am and 6pm. In July 2020, the most popular start time was 6pm and 7pm and the most popular end time was 7pm and 8pm.
In October 2019, the most popular start and stop time was 8am. In October 2020, the most popular start time was 5pm and 6pm and the most popular end time was 6pm.
